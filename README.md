## Overview

Welcome to the React Native Real Estate App! This project serves as the codebase for an educational course focused on building a modern, full-stack mobile application from scratch using React Native and the Expo framework. The goal is to move beyond outdated interfaces and demonstrate how to build a visually appealing and functional real estate browsing app, covering everything from authentication to displaying property details.

This application replicates common mobile app patterns, featuring secure authentication, content browsing, search/filtering, detail views, and user profiles, all built using the latest recommended tools like Expo SDK 52, Appwrite for the backend, TypeScript for type safety, and NativeWind for efficient styling.

## Features

*   **Google Authentication:** Secure user sign-in using Google OAuth, managed via Appwrite.
*   **Expo Router Navigation:** File-based routing manages navigation between screens. Includes a tab bar for core sections (Home, Explore, Profile) and stack navigation for detail views.
*   **Homepage:**
    *   Personalized user greeting.
    *   Horizontally scrollable "Featured" properties section (`FlatList`).
    *   Vertically scrollable list of "Recommended" properties (`FlatList`).
    *   Reusable Search component with debouncing (`use-debounce`).
    *   Reusable Filters component (property type chips).
*   **Explore Page:**
    *   Browse all properties with integrated Search and Filters.
    *   Grid layout display of properties.
    *   Custom header with back navigation.
*   **Property Details Page:**

## Technology Stack

*   **Framework:** React Native (via Expo Managed Workflow)
*   **Development Environment:** Expo (SDK 52+)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Backend:** Appwrite (Authentication, Database, Avatars)
*   **Styling:** NativeWind (Tailwind CSS)
*   **Routing:** Expo Router (File-based)
*   **State Management:** React `useState`, React `useContext` (for Global Auth State)
*   **Data Fetching:** Custom Hook (`useAppwrite`) + Appwrite SDK
*   **Expo Modules:** `expo-linking`, `expo-font`, `expo-splash-screen`
*   **Core Components:** `SafeAreaView`, `ScrollView`, `FlatList`, `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `TextInput`, `TouchableOpacity`, `ActivityIndicator`
*   **Utility Libraries:** `use-debounce`

## Architecture

The project follows a component-based architecture facilitated by Expo Router for navigation and React Context for global state management (primarily authentication).

*   **`app/` Directory:** Contains all screen components and layout routes defined by Expo Router. Nested layouts (`app/root/_layout.tsx`, `app/root/tabs/_layout.tsx`) manage shared UI and route protection.
*   **`lib/` Directory:** Houses core logic, including Appwrite SDK setup (`appwrite.ts`), the custom data-fetching hook (`useAppwrite.ts`), global state management (`GlobalProvider.tsx`), data definitions (`data.ts`), and database seeding (`seed.ts`).
*   **`components/` Directory:** Stores reusable UI components (e.g., `Search.tsx`, `Filters.tsx`, `Card.tsx`, `FeaturedCard.tsx`, `NoResults.tsx`, `SettingsItem.tsx`).
*   **`constants/` Directory:** Centralizes static data arrays and asset imports/exports.
*   **`assets/` Directory:** Contains static assets like fonts and images.
*   **Custom Hook (`useAppwrite`):** A key architectural choice abstracting Appwrite calls, managing loading/error states, and providing refetch capabilities, similar in concept to libraries like Tanstack Query.
*   **Global Provider (`GlobalProvider`):** Uses React Context to make authentication status and user data available throughout the authenticated parts of the application.

## Appwrite Setup

This application requires an Appwrite backend instance for authentication and data storage.

1.  **Create an Appwrite Project:** Sign up/log in at [cloud.appwrite.io](https://cloud.appwrite.io) (or your self-hosted instance) and create a new project.
2.  **Create Database & Collections:**
    *   Create a database (e.g., "development"). Note its **Database ID**.
    *   Create the following collections within the database, noting their respective **Collection IDs**:
        *   `agents`
        *   `galleries`
        *   `reviews`
        *   `properties`
    *   Configure the attributes and relationships for each collection precisely as outlined in the course video or the `seed.ts` file comments. Mismatched attributes will cause the seed function or data fetching to fail.
    *   **Crucially, set permissions for *each* collection:** Go to Settings -> Permissions for each collection, select "Any", and check all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) boxes for development purposes.
3.  **Register Platforms:**
    *   Add a **React Native** platform (under Home -> Your Project -> Platforms). Enter your app name (e.g., "restate") and package name (e.g., `com.jsm.restate` - must match `config.platform` in `lib/appwrite.ts`).
    *   Add a **Web** platform (e.g., "restate-web") with hostname set to `*` (asterisk). This is needed for the OAuth redirect handling.
4.  **Configure Google OAuth:**
    *   Follow the steps in the video (or Appwrite docs) to set up Google OAuth via Google Cloud Console.
    *   Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials (Web application type).
    *   Add the **Authorized Redirect URI** provided by Appwrite (found in Auth -> Settings -> Google) to your Google Cloud credentials.
    *   Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Google Cloud Console into your Appwrite Google Auth settings and enable it.

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git <-- Replace with your repo URL
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure Appwrite Environment Variables:** See the section below.
4.  **Run the App:**
    *   Start the Expo development server:
        ```bash
        npx expo start
        ```
    *   Scan the QR code using the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device, or press 'a'/'i' in the terminal to launch on a simulator/emulator (requires Android Studio/Xcode setup).
5.  **(Optional but Recommended) Seed the Database:**
    *   Once the app is running, navigate to the Home screen.
    *   *(Note: The seed button was temporarily added in the course. You might need to uncomment/re-add the `<Button title="Seed" onPress={seed} />` temporarily in `app/root/tabs/index.tsx` if it was removed).*
    *   Press the "Seed" button **once** to populate your Appwrite database with initial data. Remove the button afterwards.

## Configuration - Appwrite Environment Variables

You need to connect the app to **your** Appwrite project.

1.  **Create an Environment File:** In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env.local` (or `.env` if preferred, but ensure it's in your `.gitignore`).
2.  **Add Variables:** Populate the file with the IDs copied during the Appwrite setup:

```.env
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1" # Or your self-hosted endpoint
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID="YOUR_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID"
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID="YOUR_DATABASE_ID"
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_AGENTS_COLLECTION_ID="YOUR_AGENTS_COLLECTION_ID"
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_GALLERIES_COLLECTION_ID="YOUR_GALLERIES_COLLECTION_ID"
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_REVIEWS_COLLECTION_ID="YOUR_REVIEWS_COLLECTION_ID"
EXPO_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROPERTIES_COLLECTION_ID="YOUR_PROPERTIES_COLLECTION_ID"
```

3.  **Replace Placeholders:** Substitute `"YOUR_..."` with the actual IDs from your Appwrite project console.
4.  **Restart:** If the app was already running, **stop** the Expo server (Ctrl+C) and restart it (`npx expo start`) for the environment variables to be loaded.

**⚠️ Warning:** Do **NOT** commit your `.env` file containing sensitive IDs or potential future keys to version control. Add it to your `.gitignore` file.
